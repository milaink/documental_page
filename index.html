          There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and
          its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across
          cultures. The three classical branches of visual art are painting,
          sculpture, and architecture.Theatre, dance, and other performing arts,
          as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive
          media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.

          >One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the
          older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft",
          as associated with words such as "artisan".</code
        >
        <p>
          English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial,
          artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many
          other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its
          etymology. 20th-century bottle, Twa peoples, Rwanda. Artistic works
          may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.
          Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Kant,
          among others, questioned the meaning of art.Several dialogues in Plato
          tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by
          the muses, and is not rational.

          Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found,
          but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so
          little is known about the cultures that produced them.

          Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of
          the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia,
          India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec.
          Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and
          characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of
          these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of
          their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later
          times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists
          worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the
          human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show
          musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.

          The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being
          human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external
          purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must
          do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is
          therefore beyond utility.

          Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high
          quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of
          society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in
          the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many
          different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas
          are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not
          restricted to a social elite.though other forms of art may have been.
          Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and
          were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek
          Tanagra figurines to a very wide market. Cylinder seals were both
          artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely
          called the middle class in the Ancient Near East.Once coins were
          widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest
          range of society.

          Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some
          viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern
          controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view.
          Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of
          reasons, including religious ones. Aniconism is a general dislike of
          either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has
          been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in
          the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain
          especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it
          depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other
          groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken
          very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider
          public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as
          with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the
          Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Last Judgment by
          Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches
          of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the
          patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the
          advent of Romanticism, and economic changes in the production of art,
          the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his
          art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing
          their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and
          publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. Théodore
          Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (c. 1820), was in part a political
          commentary on a recent event. Édouard Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe
          (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but
          because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the
          time, rather than in robes of the antique world. John Singer Sargent's
          Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X) (1884), caused a controversy over the
          reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too
          suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's
          reputation.The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of
          realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the
          19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over
          a century.
